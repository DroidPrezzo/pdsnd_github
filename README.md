### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

### Description
This Project uses Python and Pandas to enable a user analyze the data of a Bike rental store for 6 months in three US cities. It allows users to calculate frequent travel destination, total travel time, mean travel time, average trip duration, the most used stations etc. It gives insight into the operations of the store which can be useful for making conclusions or concrete decisions about the store.

### Files used
Files Used include Bikeshare data for New York: new_york_city.csv, Washington: washington.csv and Chicago: chicago.csv. A Python script bikeshare.py was created to analyze the data from all CSV files.
### Author
Precious Sani is the sole author of this project.
### Credits
Aritra's repository (https://github.com/Aritra96) helped with understanding the structure of the function required to view raw data.

Pandas documentation https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide was quite helpful in understanding how to create operations in pandas.

The Python Programming for Data Science Instructor Notes and practice problems also helped greatly in completing this projects.

The Udacity reviewers also had great impact on my work by making valid suggestions and corrections for my project to pass the required rubrics.
