### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

### Description
This Project uses Python and Pandas to enable a user analyze the data of a Bike rental store for 6 months in three US cities. It gives insight into the operations of the Bike rental store which can be useful for making conclusions or concrete decisions about the store.

The statistics computed in this project are:
1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

2) Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3) Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time

4) User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
### Files used
Files Used in this project include Bikeshare data for New York: new_york_city.csv, Washington: washington.csv and Chicago: chicago.csv. A Python script bikeshare.py was created to analyze the data from all CSV files.

### Credits
Aritra's repository (https://github.com/Aritra96) helped with understanding the structure of the function required to view raw data.

Pandas documentation https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide was quite helpful in understanding how to create operations in pandas.

The Python Programming for Data Science Instructor Notes and practice problems also helped greatly in completing this projects.

The Udacity reviewers also had great impact on my work by making valid suggestions and corrections for my project to pass the required rubrics.
